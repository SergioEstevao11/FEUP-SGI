## Project information
### Scene
- A dynamic positioning of the components paired with relevant camera position produced astounding realistic perspectives
- Our project is a Star Wars inspired scene that includes the following:
  - Spaceship chasing scene involving:
    - a Millenium Falcon (with different color schemes, custom headlight);
    - 3 Tie Fighters (with different color headlights);
  - A planet resembling Saturn;
  - A small Star;
  - A Moon;
  - A space background;
  - Nurb surfaces on all rectangles in the scene, Millenium Falcon's parabolic and propulsor air ducts;
  - An animated chasing sequence with:
    - a Millenium Falcon oscillating and firing bullets;
    - a Tie Fighter traveling in a helix trajectory, dodging the bullets;
    - a Tie Fighter traveling in a parabole trajectory;
    - a Tie Fighter performing a parabole trajectory followed by a "barrel roll";
  - Shaders applied on:
    - the small star, simulating a supernova;
    - Millenium Falcon's bullets;
    - Saturn's rings;
    - Millenium Falcon's parabolica plate;
    - Milleniun Falcon's parabolica antena point.

## Issues/Problems

- The lighting sometimes can seem a bit unrealistic since some spots in the scene can seem way too dark compared to others;
- Performance issues detected in some computers.
